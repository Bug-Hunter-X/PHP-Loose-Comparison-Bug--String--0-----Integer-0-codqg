The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. 

```php
$value = '0';
if ($value === 0) {
    echo "Value is 0 (integer)";
} else {
    echo "Value is not 0 (integer)";
}
```

This code will correctly output "Value is not 0 (integer)" because '0' (string) is not strictly equal to 0 (integer).  This ensures accurate conditional logic and prevents unexpected behavior.
